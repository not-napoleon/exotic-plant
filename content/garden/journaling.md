---

I've been keeping a journal since late 2016, and have found it both helpful
and entertaining. I describe what I do as "bullet journal inspired", although
at this point, it's drifted pretty far from the original bullet journal ideas,
and I tend to focus more on memory and reflection than on organization.  For
2023, I'm trying to incorporate some more long form writing, and more
formalized review processes throughout the year.  

## How I Organize Goals
I do an annual goal setting exercise, in which I review the previous year's
goals and write an updated goals list for the new year. First, I set out a
theme for the year, which helps me focus my planning.  During the Covid-19
pandemic crisis, those themes tended to focus on just getting through the
year, but as we emerge into a less acute phase of the pandemic, I'm hoping to
have the mental space to focus on broader personal growth themes.

After setting a theme, I block out "big goals".  These are things I expect to
take many small actions to support throughout the year, and I try to list some
examples of those actions along with the goal.  I try not to have too many of
these, as it is easy to get overwhelmed, and then nothing gets done. A big
goal would be something like planned home improvement projects.

I then lay out some "small steps".  These are things that are important to me,
but are mostly one-and-done type tasks, or habits that don't require a lot of
planning. Small steps might be things like "check the 401k and rebalance if
necessary".

Finally, I include a "keep it up" section, for things I already have well
incorporated into my life.  I like to take some time to acknowledge and review
these things, and make sure I still want to have them in my life. 

When setting goals, I struggle with finding the right balance between
aspirational and achievable. For a long time, I made goals that didn't take
into account what I already knew I had to do, with reasoning something like
"well, I know I'm going to get to that anyway, my goals should be things I'm
reaching for".  I now believe that to be counter productive, and try to set
goals that acknowledge the reality of what I have going on.  This is not just
for the "keep it up" section, but also gets reflected in my big goals for the
year and monthly specific goals.

## End of Year Review
### By The Numbers
I do one page where I track my "stats" for the year.  What exactly gets
tracked varies a bit from year to year, but generally includes books read
(sometimes page counts if I tracked them), postcards and letters sent,
vacation and sick days used, and similar things.

### Major Events and Accomplishments
I also read back through the year and make note of any "major events", with a
date and a page reference.  Major events can include personal milestones
(e.g starting a new job), world events (e.g. the start of the pandemic), or
just dates I want to remember (e.g. a friend's wedding).  This serves as a
supplement to my table of contents, as I don't always recognize that an event
is something I'll want to find later when I'm first writing about it.

### Goals Review
I review my big goals for the year, and for each one I have four sections: How
did it go; what made this hard; what helped with this; and what are the next
steps.  For smaller goals, I just make a few notes on how it went.

### Quadrants
Finally, I do a four quadrant page with best of the year, worst of the year,
what to carry forward, and what to leave behind.
