# On the Assumption of Malice

I feel like "Don't assume malice" gets thrown around a lot in corporate
communication culture these days. And while I generally support giving people
the benefit of the doubt, I think this doctrine creates a lot of problems.

"Assume" is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence. What one person
calls an assumption, another person might call a pattern of barely acceptable
behavior. It's not unreasonable to think that a "weaponized question" was
weaponized on purpose.

## Hiding behind the assumption of good intent
It's important to look at policies from the viewpoint of how they could be
attacked. In this case, it's pretty straightforward. The entire idea of a "dog
whistle" is plausible deniability of intent. 

## Context and history matter.
This is where "assume" really has to come under the microscope. The first time
someone does something offensive and pleads ignorance, maybe it is reasonable
to grant them some benefit of the doubt. But when a pattern develops over
time, the same excuses over and over, then it is no longer an assumption of
malice.  

## Ignorance is not innocence
Often, the response to being told "this thing hurt me" is to plead ignorance.
"I didn't realize that was a concern," or similar, and of course to expect
that the wounded party accept that your ignorance was not malicious. But at
some point, ignorance itself becomes malice. To remain ignorant of the ways in
which your decisions impact those around you is not, and cannot be, a free
pass for bad behavior.

"Don't assume malice" culture needs to be bi-directional. The person being
given the benefit of the doubt needs to acknowledge that they have a harmful
gap in their knowledge, and seek to correct it. That work is on them, and is
the price of having the transgression forgiven.

## Direction of power
It seems to me that "Don't assume malice" often gets said in response to
someone, typically someone who isn't in a position of power, expressing their
hurt.  It then becomes this thing where the person who was hurt needs to
explain to the person who hurt them why it hurt and how they trust that it
wasn't on purpose, and generally make the person who hurt them feel better
about the situation.  That seems wrong.

We see a lot of "I was hurt, then I reminded myself 'don't assume malice' and
reached out to try to understand..."  We rarely see "You seemed upset about what
I said, but I didn't assume malice and am reaching out to see why you're upset."

## Outcome matter as much as intentions
Fundamentally, "don't assume malice" culture is about giving weight to
people's intentions in a situation, and that is a good thing. But intentions
cannot and should not weight heavier than outcomes. At the end of the day, it
is the outcome of actions that leave a mark upon the world, not their
intentions.
