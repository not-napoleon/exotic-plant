This is a bit of a new hobby for me, and I haven't actually bought the plotter
itself yet. Currently, I'm trying to generate compatible SVG files in python,
and I'm waiting until I have some stuff that looks cool before I invest in the
actual machine. My first attempt at trying to draw something that looks cool
will be mazes on curved coordinate systems.
