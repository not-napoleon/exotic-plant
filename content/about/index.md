I was born and raised in New York, and am currently living in Baltimore. I'm a software engineer by trade.  Right now, I work for [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) on the fantastic open source Elasticsearch search engine. I write Java professionally, and Python for fun.

When I'm not working, I enjoy hiking and [photography](https://photography.marktozzi.com/), board game and table top RPGs, and the occasional video game. I read a lot of novels, mostly science fiction and fantasy.
