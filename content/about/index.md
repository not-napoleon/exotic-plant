I was born and raised in New York, and am currently living in Baltimore. I'm a
software engineer by trade.  Right now, I work for
[Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) on the fantastic open source Elasticsearch
search engine. I write Java professionally, and Python for fun.

When I'm not working, I enjoy hiking and
[photography](https://photography.marktozzi.com/), board game and table top
RPGs, and the occasional video game. I read a lot of novels, mostly science
fiction and fantasy.
